This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(rgdal)
rueil <- readOGR(dsn = "data/rueil-malmaison-20170112.shp")
head(rueil@data,2)
```



```{r}
library(broom)
rueil_df <- tidy(rueil)
head(rueil_df,500)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(rueil_df, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon() + geom_path(colour = "white", lwd = 0.05) + coord_equal() +
  labs(x = "lat", y = "lon", fill = "Job Offers") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#BDBDBD", high = "#2196F3", name = "Job Offers")
